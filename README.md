Hi, this is my todo application created using Angular for the frontend and Express for the scripting and MongoDB as DB for the backend.

To use this project, Clone the "new"repository, Create a users and tasks collection in the same db on compass or anywhere else. 

In the doto-backend folder go to the .env, add your URL in the MONGO_URL for the connection to the backend. Also create the users through the frontend.

Flow goes according to dotos png file.

After logging in, on the frontend you can create,edit and delete tasks for a user. 

There are two columns, pending and completed tasks, you can drag the tasks from pending to completed tasks, you can also do it vice-versa.
